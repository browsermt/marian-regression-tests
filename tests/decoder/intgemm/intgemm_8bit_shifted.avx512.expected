Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Post, Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in Spain, known in the criminal world, was detained by police in Spain as Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took custody of three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspect is said to be members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society between the ages of 27 and 57, who are mainly involved in drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mijas, Spain.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of suspects in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in a criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly divided in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug crimes and thus generate criminal proceeds," said the head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, Vahur Verte, a state prosecutor.
"We are not ruling out increasing the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement agencies in the past, and some have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish counterparts had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the collaboration," prosecutor Verte said.
Ago Leis, head of the CCC, said the arrests were preceded by a year-and-a-half probe.
"In the first half of the long-running work, we have recorded suspicion of crimes in Estonia and in Spain," he said.
The inquest added that officers from the Metropolitan Police were assisting in the arrest in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we will get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men who have been arrested may continue to commit new crimes while at large, which is why the prosecution has requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his transfer to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized in this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case will be carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and chaired by the Public Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted of racketeering in 2005 by the Tallinn district court and sentenced to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov, then the underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxiderned taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged businessmen with monthly rookie fees.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come into force confirm that the fight in the area of organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight defendants from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Association criminal case, who were ordered to have their criminal proceeds of BGN 80,000, or the verdict against nine individuals, in 2006 for Igor Aleynikov, to a criminal association aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and committing crimes related to human trafficking in East Virginia and the South of Estonia.
Confirlated criminal proceeds there are around 71,500 euros.
In these criminal matters, it has ensured that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out activities in any European Union country together.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advanced People of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Mussuri, which runs until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the state, given the entire rally of the suspicious racial events that have occurred recently across the state and are also brought out."
The NAACP said the group urged both the recent Missouri law to issue a travel warning, making it harder to win discrimination lawsuits, and the fact that the state's law enforcement officers target minorities in an unequal way.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are pulled onto the side of the road because of the colour of their skin, beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that in the state, black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than white people.
"It's designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, putting the state at 16th place in the state's number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder for the company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel notices for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws requiring local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have started to use the measure as a counter-reaction to certain U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different, A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which can develop into cirrhosis of the liver, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer, has a poor cost.
Moodow Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser to the NHS, says acute hepatitis is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, planting, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sneeze, dark urine, muscular and joint pain, and the collarbone of the skin and mucus.
The most recent disease also comes from the popular name collie disease of liver inflammation.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be identified from data from laboratory studies.
Extreme hepatitis can transition into chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-related disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stools of an infected person to their hands and from arms to food, objects, objects, mouth and drug use.
The risk of hepatitis infection, or at-risk family members and carers, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected people, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A high spread.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people travelling at risk of vaccination and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene compliance is important: wash or disinfect all fruit and vegetables before using them for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-armed, using blood-soaked creatures (toothbrushes, squatting tools), having donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis-boy person, and having hepatitis from mother to foetal/born.
The injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care workers and police who are exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people in order to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk of vaccination, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes, are recommended.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of alien hygiene and manicured equipment, other sharpeners and needles, tattooing and hole-in-duty, and the use of condoms in the event of infectious sex or avoiding sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free for children in Estonia as part of the national immunisation scheme.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-cheek, using blood-contaminated creatures, having donor blood, having sex with hepatitis a person and from hepatitis to mother to foetus/nonnavigation.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug users, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, HIV-infected individuals, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
The preventive measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicured equipment, other sharpeners and syringe-indulging, and using condoms for condom-threatening-threatening sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in combination with hepatitis B or a super infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through contact with blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated needles, sexually and from the rarely infected mother to the foetus.
Hepatitis D is a risk group for chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people with non-intensity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread through fetal-oral tea with drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, joint-use syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Travellers can become infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Hepatitis prevention measures include meeting hygiene requirements: wash or disinfectant after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Beat fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to sprint off the four-time Olympic champion in the final round, the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife, Tania, and the children along with her after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I very much miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in London for a row of 5,000 and a 10,000-metre run.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold; the extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" of one artwork, delved much deeper into the cultural life of the late 19th and early 20th-century Vienna.
But even more in history.
The ensuing amount of information might have been worn out, a thinner subject, a narrower subject that allowed the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence.
There would be two books between the covers: Gustav Klimt and his painting "Daam in Gold," the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a far larger and more comprehensive historical history record of the esteemed Jewish family and the German occupation, along with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a bustling Vienna, and whoever has themselves entered the Austrian capital can imagine, without the slight effort, how life went around Ringstrasse more than 100 years ago, or how everyone in Central Cafe turned its head when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see the familiar name in the book, you feel like a more grammar of cultures.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where untreated syphilis and had the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to add nothing to the story's progress.
Or perhaps, every pair of brushstrokes adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
The dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in 10 residents of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open a Czech sugar magnate, Ferdinand Bloch, and Klimt was posing for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't pull the whole glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Dama in Gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
