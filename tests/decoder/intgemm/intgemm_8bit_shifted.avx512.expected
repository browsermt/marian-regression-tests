Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Post, police detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky, was detained by police in Spain.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took custody of three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspect is said to be members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society aged 27-57, mainly committing drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mija.
Three men were arrested on suspicion in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly divided in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug crimes and thus generate criminal proceeds," said Mr Verte, head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We are not ruling out increasing the number of suspects in this case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have served sentences for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with his Spanish counterparts had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the collaboration," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Metropolitan Police Service, said the arrests were preceded by a probation for nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the year, the long-running work materialised and we simultaneously detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
The inquest added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in the arrest in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we will get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men who have been charged can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting transfer to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized as part of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted of extortion and sentenced to five years in prison by a district court in Tallinn.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov, then the underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxiderned taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and demanded monthly rookie fees from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court judgments that have come into force confirm that the fight in the area of organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikayev Crime Command, who were ordered to pay the proceeds of BGN 80,000, or the judgment against nine individuals, in 2006 for Igor Aleynikov, who set up a criminal association aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the crimes of human trafficking in East Virginia and the South in Estonia.
Confirmed criminal proceeds there are around 71,500 euros.
In these criminal matters, progress has been made by the fact that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out actions together in any European Union country.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Midsor, which runs until August 28, 2017, invites all African-Americans, visitors and Missouriers to be particularly attentive and extremely careful when moving around the state, taking into account the suspicious racially-based events that have occurred recently across the state."
The NAACP said the group urged both the recent Missouri law to issue a travel warning, making it harder to win antitrust lawsuits and the fact that the state's law enforcement officers target minorities in an unequal way.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are pulled onto the side of the road because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
It is the first such warning issued by the organization about the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee, Tory Sanders.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note points to a recent report by the Missouri attorney general, which shows that in the state, black motorists are 75% more likely to be stopped than white people.
"It's meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, that means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, putting the state 16th in the state's number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for the company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have started using the measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different, A, B, C, and E hepatitis viruses.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C is chronic, which can develop into the liver cirrhosis, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer, has a negative cost.
Mood Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser to the NHS, says acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nastiness, vomiting, abdominal pain, numb urine, muscular and joint pain and the collarbone of the skin and mucus.
The most recent disease also comes from the popular name of liver inflammation, collaboratories.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be determined by data from a laboratory study.
Extreme hepatitis can transition into chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stools of an infected person to their hands and from their hands to food, surfaces, objects, objects, mouths and taking drugs.
Family members and carers of the disease, who are at risk of hepatitis infection, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected people, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A high.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people travelling at risk of hepatitis A, who are widely involved in the hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene compliance is essential: wash or disinfect all fruit and vegetables before using them for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-cheek, using blood-soaked creatures (toothbrushes, raspberry tools), donor blood, having sex with hepatitis-boyfriend, and having sex with a hepatitis-studded mother to foetal/born.
The injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, the newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care, rescue workers and police officers who are exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people in order to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk have been recommended, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicured equipment, other sharpeners and needles, tattooing and hole-in-duty, and the use of condoms in the event of infection-prone sex or avoiding sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free of charge for children in Estonia as part of the national immunisation scheme.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, holed up, using blood-soaked creatures, donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis person, and from a hepatitis patient to the foetus/naive.
The risk of hepatitis C infection includes injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, infected mother's newborns, sick family members and carers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis C.
The preventive measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicured equipment, other sharpeners and needles, tattooing and sniffing, and the use of condoms in cases of infection-prone sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by a hepatitis D virus that reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection is associated with hepatitis B or a super infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through contact with blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated needles, sexually and from the rarely infected mother to the foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread through fetal-oral drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Travellers can become infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Hepatitis prevention measures include hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Beef and vegetables to wash before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to squeeze the four-time Olympic champion off course in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along the way after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I very much miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a 5,000-metre and golden doubles for the fifth title race in a row in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold; Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's Portrait of Ancient, delves much deeper into the origin story of one of the artworks" from the birth story of the late 19th and early 20th-century Vienna.
But even more in history.
The glorious amount of information might have been worn out, perhaps a louder cut, a narrower subject allowed to allow the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence.
There would be two books now on the cover: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in her painting "Daam in Gold," and a far larger and more comprehensive historical record of esteemed Jewish families and the German occupation, along with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a bustling Vienna, and whoever finds themselves in the Austrian capital, one can imagine how life around Ringstrasse more than 100 years ago, or how everyone in Central Cafe turned his head when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see the name you know in the book, you feel like a more grammar culture.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where incurable syphilis and was the highest suicide rate in Europe gives nothing to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, anyway, every pair of brushstrokes add colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
The dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in ten residents of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open a Czech sugar magnate, Ferdinand Bloch, and Klimt was posing for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't pull the whole glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Dami in gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of his life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
