Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian underworld and is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky, was detained by police in Spain, according to the Post.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
The suspect is said to be members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society between the ages of 27 and 57, who are mainly involved in drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mijas, Malaga province, Spain.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of being arrested in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal association and two are members of the criminal association, according to the data collected.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly divided in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug offences and thus generate criminal proceeds," said Mr Verte, head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We are not ruling out that the number of suspects in this case will increase," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with its Spanish counterparts has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the arrests were preceded by a year-and-a-half-long preliminary investigation.
"In the first half of the year, the long-running work materialised and we detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
Leis added that officers from the Central Criminal Police were assisting in the arrest in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men suspected of continuing to commit new crimes while at large, which is why the prosecution requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting transfer to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized as part of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted of extortion and sentenced to five years in prison in 2005.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov, then the underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxided taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged businessmen with monthly rookie fees.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Association criminal case who were ordered to receive a criminal offence of EUR 80,000, or the judgment of nine individuals in 2006 for Igor Aleynikov, who aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the crimes of human trafficking in East Virginia and the South in Estonia, in 2006.
Confidential criminal proceeds there are around EUR 71,500.
In these criminal matters, it has ensured that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out actions in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "An NAACP travel note issued for the state of Mussuri, which runs until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-Americans, visitors and Missouriers to be particularly vigilant and extremely careful as they move around the state, taking into account the suspicious racially-based events that have occurred recently across the state."
The NAACP said the group urged the travel warning to issue both the recent Missouri law, making it harder to win antitrust lawsuits and the fact that the state's law enforcement agencies target minorities in an unequal way.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are pulled to the side of the road because of the colour of their skin, beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
It is the first such warning the organization has issued about the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the comment cites a recent report by the Missouri attorney general that shows that in the state, black drivers are 75% more likely to stop cars than white people.
"It's about making people aware and warning their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state 16th in the state's list of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder for the company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel updates on Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Foreign Office for other countries, but recently interest groups have started using the measure as a countervisor to certain laws and trends in the U.S..
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different - A, B, C, D and E virus.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C has chronic hepatitis, which can develop into liver cirrhosis, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer.
Moodow Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Department of Health, says acute hepatitis is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, glandular excitement, dark urine, muscular and joint pain, and the yellowness of the skin and mucus.
The most recent disease also comes from the popular name for liver inflammation.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Various types of inflammation can only be identified from the data from the laboratory study.
Extreme hepatitis can transition into chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without signs of illness, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stools of an infected person to their hands and hands to their arms, surfaces, objects, mouths and drug use.
Family members and carers of hepatitis infection, known as risk-taking groups, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected men, drug users, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A high-poverty.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people travelling at risk of vaccination and in a hepatitis A risk group.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are essential: wash or disinfect your hands before using all fruit and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-cheek, blood-soaked creatures (toothbrushes, waste products), donor blood, having sex with hepatitis a person, and having hepatitis from a mother to foetus/born.
The injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, the newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers and police officers who come into contact with blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis B.
People can be vaccinated to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk have been recommended, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and syringes, tattooing and holeing, and the use of condoms in cases of intestinal sex or avoiding sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free of charge for children in Estonia as part of the national immunisation scheme and for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, holed up, using blood contaminated with livers, having sex with hepatitis, having sex with a hepatitis-deaf person, and from hepatitis to mother to foetus/nonnavigation.
The risk of hepatitis C infection includes injection drug addicts, sextives of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, HIV-infected individuals, and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis C high disease.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of alien hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and syringe-indulging, and using condoms for infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis.
Hepatitis D is caused by a hepatitis D virus that reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in hepatitis B or a super infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through exposure to blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and from the rarely infected mother to the foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread fetal-oral tea with drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Passengers can become infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Hepatitis prevention measures include meeting hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Washing fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to get the four-time Olympic champion off course in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along with her after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I greatly miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in a row in London with a 5,000 and 10,000-metre run golden duo.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" delves much deeper into the origin story of one artwork from the birth story of the late 19th and early 20th-century Vienna.
But even more in history.
The awesome amount of information might have worn off, a louder cut, a narrower subject that allowed the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence.
There would be two books on the same cover now: the story of Gustav Klimt and his painting "Daam in Gold," Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a far larger and comprehensive historical record of respectable Jewish families and the German occupation, along with its after-effects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the scorched Vienna cultural life in the midst of the bustling Vienna, and who have themselves in the Austrian capital, one can imagine how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone in Central Cafe turned when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see the familiar name in the book, you feel like a more grammar.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where he was subjected to incurable syphilis and was the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to give nothing to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, every pair of brushstrokes add colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in ten of Vienna's residents was a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married her two-time open-minded Ferdinand Bloch, a Czech sugar magnate and Klimt, for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't pull on all the glamorous life she was a part of.
Looking at "Damid in gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of his life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
