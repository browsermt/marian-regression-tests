Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Post, police detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in Spain, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society between the ages of 27 and 57, who are mainly responsible for drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mijas, Malaga province, Spain.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of suspects in Estonia, including one leading figure in the criminal association and two of them members of the criminal association, according to the data collected.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly divided in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association was to commit drug offences and thus generate criminal proceeds," said the head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, said Va. Verte, a state prosecutor.
"We are not ruling out that the number of suspects in this criminal case will increase," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with its Spanish counterparts had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the collaboration," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the arrests were preceded by a year-and-a-half probe.
"In the first half of the day, the long-running work materialised and we detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
The inquest added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in the arrest in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we will get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men who have been charged can continue to commit new crimes while at large, which is why the prosecution has requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting retribution for him to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized as part of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted of extortion and sentenced to five years in prison by a district court in Tallinn.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov, then an underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxiderned taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged businessmen with monthly rookie fees.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come into force confirm that the fight in the area of organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight defendants from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Association criminal case who were ordered to have seized EUR 80,000 for the proceeds of criminal damage, or the judgment of nine individuals, that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the crimes of human trafficking in East Virginia and the South in Estonia.
Confident criminal proceeds there are around 71,500 euros.
In these criminal matters, it has ensured that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out actions in any European Union country together.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Mussuri, which runs until August 28, 2017, invites all African-Americans, visitors and Missourians to be particularly vigilant and extremely careful as they move around the state, taking into account the suspicious racially-based events that have occurred recently across the state and are also brought out."
The NAACP said the group urged both the recent Missouri law to issue a travel warning, making it harder to win discrimination lawsuits, and the fact that the state's law enforcement officers target minorities in an unequal way.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are pulled onto the side of the road because of the color of their skin, beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that in the state, black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of whites.
"It's meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouris documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state ranked 16th in the state in terms of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder for the company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel notices for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have started using the measure as a counter-reaction to certain internal US laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different - A, B, C, and E, hepatitis virus.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C have chronic hepatitis, which can develop into liver cirrhosis, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer, has a negative cost.
Mooth Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser to the NHS, says acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, planting, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sneoch, dark urine, muscular and joint pain, and the yellowness of the skin and mucus.
The most recent disease also comes from the popular name for liver inflammation.
In children, hepatitis can go ahead without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be determined based on data from laboratory studies.
Extreme hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and can go on for decades without signs of disease, which means a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Listo Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stool of an infected person to their hands and hands to their arms, surfaces, objects, mouth and drug use.
Family members and caregivers who are at risk of hepatitis infection, known as risk-taking, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected people, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis A.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people travelling at risk of vaccination and in a hepatitis A risk group.
In addition, daily hygiene compliance is important: wash or disinfect all fruit and vegetables before using them for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, holed up, using blood-contaminated creatures (toothbrushes, waste products), having sex with donor blood, hepatitis sushi and having hepatitis from mother to foetal/born.
The injection drug addicts, sex partners of infected people, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers and police who are exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
People can be vaccinated to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk of being vaccinated, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes, are recommended.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of alien hygiene and manicure products, other sharpeners and syringes and needles, tattooing and the use of a condom in the event of infection-prone sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free of charge for the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, holed up, using blood-contaminated creatures, donor blood, having sex with hepatitis a person and from hepatitis to mother to foetus/naive birth.
The risk of hepatitis C infection includes injection drug users, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, infected mother's newborns, sick family members and caregivers, health workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, HIV infections, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and syringe-infections, tattooing and holeing, and condom use for condom-threatention-threatened sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by a hepatitis D virus that reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in hepatitis B or a super infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread in contact with blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated syringes, sexually transmitted and from a rarely infected mother to the foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread through fetal orbald tea with drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Passengers can become infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Hepatitis prevention measures include hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to squeeze the four-time Olympic champion off the track in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along with him after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I greatly miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in London in a row with a golden duo of 5,000 and 10,000 metres.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" delves much deeper into the origin story of one artwork from the origin story of the late 19th and early 20th-century Vienna.
But even more in history.
The awesome amount of information might have worn off, a louder cute, a narrower subject allowed to have more of an impact on the extraordinary story of the portrait allowed in the title.
There would be two books in the same box now: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, portrayed in her painting "Daam in Gold," and a far larger and comprehensive historical record of respectable Jewish families and German occupation, along with its after-effects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the scorching Vienna cultural life, and whoever has themselves entered the Austrian capital, one can imagine how life went around Ringstrasse more than 100 years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the café in Central when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see a familiar name in the book, you feel like a more grammar of cultures.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where incurable syphilis was rampant and had the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to add to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, every pair of brushstrokes adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten of Vienna's residents were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married her two-time open-minded Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Blach and Klimt for her famous paintings, her father had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't pull the whole glamorous life to which she belonged.
Looking at "Damid in gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of his life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
