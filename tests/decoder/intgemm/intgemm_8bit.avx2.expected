Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Post, police detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky, by police in Spain.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
The suspect is said to be members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society between the ages of 27 and 57, who are mainly involved in drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mija, Malaga province, Spain.
Three men were arrested on suspicion in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal association and two are members of the criminal association, according to the data collected.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly divided in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug offences and thus generate criminal proceeds," said Mr Verte, head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We are not ruling out an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with its Spanish counterparts had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Metropolitan Police Service, said the arrests had been preceded by a year-and-a-half probe.
"In the first half of the year, the long-running work materialised and we detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
Leis added that officers from the Central Criminal Police were assisting in the arrest in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men suspected of continuing to commit new crimes while at large, which is why the prosecution requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting transfer to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized as part of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted of extortion and sentenced to five years in prison in 2005.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov, then an underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxiderned taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged businessmen with monthly rookie fees.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come to lighten up confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest verdicts, eight defendants from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Community criminal case, who were ordered to pay the proceeds of a criminal offence of EUR 80,000, or the judgment against nine individuals, that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the crimes of human trafficking in East Virginia and in southern Estonia.
Confidential criminal income there is around EUR 71,500.
Success in these criminal matters has ensured that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out actions in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Midsuad, which runs until August 28, 2017, invites all African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the state, given the entire roster of suspicious racial-based events that have occurred recently across the state and are also listed here."
The NAACP said the group urged both the recent Missouri law to issue a travel warning, making it harder to win cases involving discrimination, and the fact that it is minority that is unequally targeted by law enforcement.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are drawn to the side of the road because of the colour of their skin, they are beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
It is the first such warning issued by the organization about the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by police in Missouri without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the comment refers to a recent report by the Missouri attorney general, which shows that in the state, black motorists are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of whites.
"It's meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it's going to take bail money or to inform relatives that they're going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state 16th in the state in terms of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder for the company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel briefings for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Foreign Office for other countries, but recently interest groups have started using the measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends in the U.S..
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different - A, B, C, D and E virus.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C have chronic hepatitis, which can develop into the liver cirrhosis, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer, at a bad cost.
Mooo Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Department of Health, says acute hepatitis is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, glandular extremities, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and skin and mucus.
The most recent disease also comes from the popular name for liver inflammation.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be identified based on data from a laboratory study.
Extreme hepatitis can transition into chronic hepatitis and can go on for decades without signs of illness, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stools of an infected person to their hands and from their hands to their arms, surfaces, objects, mouth and taking drugs.
Family members and carers of the disease, who are at risk of hepatitis infection, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with the infected, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with high hepatitis A.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people travelling at risk of vaccination and in a hepatitis A risk group.
In addition, daily hygiene compliance is essential: wash or disinfect your hands before using all fruits and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when a sick person is exposed to blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-aged, using blood-soaked creatures (toothbrushes, squatting tools), having donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis-chemistst egg and having a hepatitis mother to foetus/born.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care workers and police who are exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis B disease.
People can be vaccinated to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk have been recommended, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: a refrain from using alien hygiene and manicured equipment, other sharpeners and syringes, tattooing and looting, and using condoms in cases of infection-prone sex or avoiding sexual risky behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free of charge for children in Estonia as part of the national immunisation scheme.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-the-wall, using blood-contaminated creatures, donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis person and from hepatitis to mother to foetus/born.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug addicts, sextives of an infected person, men having sex with men, infected mother's newborns, sick family members and carers, health workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis C high disease.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicured equipment, other sharpeners and syringes, tattooing and holeing, and using a condom in case of infection-prone sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by a hepatitis D virus that reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in hepatitis B in combination with hepatitis B or a super infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through contact with blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and from the rarely infected mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread through fetal orxic drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, joint-exploited syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Passengers can become infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Preventing measures for hepatitis is hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Washing fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to get the four-time Olympic champion off course in the final round, the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along with her after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in a row in London with a 5,000 and 10,000-metre run golden duo.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold; the extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's Portrait," delves much deeper into the cultural life of one artwork from the history of the late 19th and early 20th centuries of Vienna.
But even more in history.
It might have been worn out, a more hectic cut-throat, a narrower subject that allowed the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence.
At present, there would be two books on the cover: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in her painting "Daam in Gold," and a much larger and more comprehensive historical record of respectable Jewish families and the German occupation, along with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a bustling Vienna, and whoever has himself entered the Austrian capital, can imagine, without the slight effort, how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see the familiar name in the book, you feel like a more grammar of cultures.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where untreated syphilis and was the highest suicide rate in Europe is not adding anything to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, every pair of brushstrokes add colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten of Vienna's residents were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married her two-time Open Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for her famous paintings, her father had become the seventh-largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't draw all the glamorous life to which she belonged.
Looking at "Dama in gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of his life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
