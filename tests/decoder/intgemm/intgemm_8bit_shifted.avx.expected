Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Post, police detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took custody of three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspect is said to be members of the so-called Kemerovo Criminal Society between the ages of 27 and 57, who are mainly involved in drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mijase, Spain.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of suspects in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in a criminal association and two are members of the criminal association, according to the data collected.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly distributed in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug offences and thus generate criminal proceeds," said Vahur Verte, the head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We are not ruling out an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with its Spanish counterparts has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the arrests were preceded by a year-and-a-half probe.
"In the first half of the year, the long-running work materialised and we simultaneously detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and in Spain," he said.
Leis added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in the arrest in Spain.
We have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard for years.
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we will get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men who have been charged may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution has requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting transfer to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized in this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted of extortion and sentenced to five years in prison by the Tallinn district court in 2005.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov, then the underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxided taxi drivers and prostitutes who operated at various hotels and charged businessmen with monthly rookie fees.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come into force confirm that the fight in the area of organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight defendants from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Community criminal case who were ordered to have seized EUR 80,000 for the conviction of nine individuals in 2006 for a criminal association aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the committing of crimes related to human trafficking in the East Village and the South in Estonia in 2006.
Confidential criminal proceeds there are around 71,500 euros.
In these criminal matters, it has ensured that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day, and if necessary, procedures are carried out together in any European Union country.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "An NAACP travel note issued for the state of Mussuri, which runs until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American travelers, visitors and Missouriers to be particularly attentive and extremely careful when moving around the state, given the entire squad of suspicious racial-based events that have occurred recently and are brought out here across the state."
The NAACP said the group urged the travel warning to issue both a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discrimination lawsuits and the fact that the state's law enforcement targets are largely minorities.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are pulled onto the side of the road because of the colour of their skin, they are beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
It is the first such warning the organization has issued about the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that in the state, cars of black motorists are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of white women.
"It's meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state in 16th place in the state's total in the state.
The travel warning is also in response to a new law in Missouri, which makes it difficult for the company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have started using the measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the U.S..
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different, A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C have a negative cost, which can develop into cirrhosis of the liver, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer.
Listo Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Department of Health, says acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, plantation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dull outlets, dark urine, muscular and joint pain, and the yellowness of the skin and mucus.
The popular name collie disease of liver inflammation also comes from the latest disease.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be identified based on data from laboratory studies.
Extreme hepatitis can transition into chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stool of an infected person to their hands and from their hands to food, objects, objects, mouth and taking drugs.
Family members and caregivers of the risk of hepatitis infection, known as risk-taking, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected people, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A high spread.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people travelling in a hepatitis A risk group, in particular, vaccination for people travelling at risk of A.
In addition, daily hygiene compliance is essential: wash or disinfect all fruit and vegetables before using them for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when a patient's blood is exposed to, injected with drugs, tattooing, hole-in-dural, blood-soaked creatures (toothbrushes, waste products), having sex with donor blood, hepatitis sushi to person, and having hepatitis from mother to foetus/born.
Inspiring drug addicts, sex partners of infected person who have sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers and police officers who come into contact with blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people in order to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk have been recommended, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of alien hygiene and manicure products, other sharpeners and syringes, tattooing and holeing, and using condoms for infectious sex or avoiding sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free for children in Estonia as part of the national immunisation scheme and is free for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, holed up, using blood-soaked creatures, donor blood, having sex with hepatitis a person, and from a hepatitis patient to the foetus/naive.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug addicts, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of alien hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and syringe-infested skulls, tattooing and sniffing, and using condoms in cases of infection-prone sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in hepatitis B or a super-infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread when exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, their contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and from the rarely infected mother to the fetus.
Hepatitis D is a risk group for chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread through drinking water and food on fetal-oral tea, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Travellers can become infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Hepatitis prevention measures include meeting hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Fruit and vegetables to wash before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While the competitors tried to sprint off the four-time Olympic champion in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along the way after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I greatly miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a golden duo of the fifth title race in a row in London with a 5,000 and 10,000 meters runner-up.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold; Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" delves much deeper into the cultural life of one art work from the late 19th and early 20th centuries of Vienna.
But even more in history.
The awesome amount of information might have been worn out, perhaps a louder cut, a narrower subject allowed to allow the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence.
There would be two books on the cover now: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, portrayed in her painting "Daam in Gold," and a much larger and more comprehensive historical history book about the esteemed Jewish family and the German occupation, along with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the scorching Vienna cultural life in the midst of the puzzling Vienna, and whoever has entered the Austrian capital, can imagine, without the slightest effort, how life went around Ringstrasse more than 100 years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the café in Central when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see the familiar name in the book, you feel like a more grammar of cultures.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where incurable syphilis was rampant and had the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to add to the development of the story.
Or, perhaps, every pair of brushstrokes adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
The dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten residents of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomer to Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open a Czech sugarmay magnate, Ferdinand Bloch, and Klimt was posing for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't draw all the glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Dama in gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
