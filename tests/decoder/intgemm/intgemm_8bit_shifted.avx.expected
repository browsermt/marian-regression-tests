Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Post, police detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky, was detained by police in Spain.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
The suspect is said to be members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society aged 27-57, who are mainly responsible for drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mijas, Spain.
Three men were arrested on suspicion in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly distributed in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug crimes and thus generate criminal proceeds," said the head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, said Mr Verte, a state prosecutor.
"We are not ruling out an increase in the number of suspects in this case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with its Spanish counterparts had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation is a success," prosecutor Verte said.
Ago Leis, head of the CCC's police service, said the arrests were preceded by a year-and-a-half probe.
"In the first half of the year, the long-running work materialised and we have arrested those suspected of crimes in Estonia and in Spain at the same time," he said.
The spokesman added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in the arrest in Spain.
We have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard for years.
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far makes it clear that the men who have been charged may continue to commit new crimes while at large, which is why the prosecution requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting transfer to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted by a district court in 2005 of racketeering and sentenced to five years in prison.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, after Nikolai Tarankov, then the underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxiderned taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and demanded monthly rookies for businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come into force confirm that the fight in the area of organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight of the eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Association criminal case, who had been ordered to pay the proceeds of BGN 80,000, or the judgment of nine individuals in 2006 for Igor Aleynikov, which aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the committing of crimes related to human trafficking in East Virginia and the South in Estonia.
Confirmed criminal proceeds there are around 71,500 euros.
Success in these criminal matters has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out actions in any European Union country together.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group said: "An NAACP travel note issued for the state of Midsor, which runs until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American travelers, visitors and Missouriers to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the state, given the entire roar of suspicious racially-based events that have occurred recently across the state and are also brought out here."
The NAACP said the group urged both the recent Missouri law to issue a travel warning, making it harder to win antitrust lawsuits, and the fact that the state's law enforcement officers target minorities for the most unequally.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled onto the side of the road because of the color of their skin, beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
It is the first such warning the organization has issued to the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri attorney general, which shows that in the state, the cars of black motorists are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of whites.
"It's meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it's going to take bail money or letting relatives know that they're going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state 16th in the state's penetrating number in terms of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder for the company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel notices for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs about other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use the measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the U.S..
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different, A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which can develop into cirrhosis of the liver, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer, is a chronic cost.
Mooo Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Department of Health, says acute hepatitis disease has the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, plantation, nastiness, vomiting, abdominal pain, sneeze, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and the yellowness of the skin and mucus.
The popular name collie disease of liver inflammation also comes from the latest disease.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Various types of inflammation can only be identified from the data from the laboratory study.
Extreme hepatitis can transition into chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, which means a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-dammable disease.
Listo Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stools of an infected person to their hands and hands to their heads, surfaces, objects, mouths and drug use.
The risk of hepatitis infection, or at-risk family members and carers, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected people, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A high-profile A.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccinations recommended for people travelling and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene compliance is important: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before using it for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when a sick person is exposed to blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, holed up, using blood-soaked creatures (toothbrush, squatting tools), having a donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis-suspecting person, and having hepatitis from a mother to foetus/born.
The injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers and police who come into contact with blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people in order to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk have been recommended, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharpeners and needles, tattooing and holeing, and using a condom in the event of infection-prone sex or avoiding sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is a free part of the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-cheek, using blood-contaminated creatures, donor blood, having sex with hepatitis, and from a hepatitis patient to the mother to the foetus/naive.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, infected mother's newborns, sick family members and carers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis C.
The preventive measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicured equipment, other sharpeners and syringe-indulging, and the use of condoms in the event of condom-threatention-prone sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by a hepatitis D virus that reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in hepatitis B or a super-infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through exposure to blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and from the rarely infected mother to the foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread fetal-oral tea with drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to the foetus.
Travellers can become infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Hepatitis prevention measures include meeting hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Beef and vegetables to wash before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
Despite the contestants trying to squeeze the four-time Olympic champion off course in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along the way after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I very much miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in London in a row with a golden duo of the 5,000 and 10,000 metres.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold; Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" delves much deeper into the origin story of one of the arts in the late 19th and early 20th century Vienna.
But even more in history.
The awesome amount of information might have been worn out, a thinner cut-throat, a narrower subject that allowed the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence.
There would be two books on the cover at the moment: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, portrayed in the painting "Daam in Gold," and a much larger and more comprehensive historical record of the esteemed Jewish family and the German occupation, along with its after-effects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a bustling Vienna, and whoever has themselves in the Austrian capital can imagine how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone in the Central Cafe turned when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see the familiar name in the book, you feel like a more grammar.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where incurable syphilis was rampant and had the highest suicide rate in Europe is not annoying the development of the story.
Or perhaps, anyway, every pair of brushstrokes adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
The dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in 10 residents of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married her two-time Open Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't draw all the glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Dama in gold," it's hard to believe that towards the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
