Four members of Kemerovo gang detained in Estonia and Spain
Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian underworld and is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky, was detained by police in Spain, according to the Post.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took custody of three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society between the ages of 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mija, Malaga province, Spain.
Three men were arrested on suspicion in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles were clearly distributed in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug offences and thus generate criminal proceeds," said Mr Verte, the head of pretrial proceedings in the criminal case and state prosecutor.
"We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have served sentences for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with its Spanish counterparts has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," prosecutor Verte said.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the arrests were preceded by a probe into nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the year, the long-term work materialised and we detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
Leis added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in their detention in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civilian Guard.
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men on suspicion of committing new crimes while in prison may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution has requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting transfer to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized in this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted by a district court in 2005 of racketeering and sentenced to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov, then underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and demanded monthly rookie taxes from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have entered into force confirm that the fight in the area of organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Association criminal case, who were ordered to pay BGN 80,000, or the judgment of nine individuals in 2006 forged a criminal association aimed at the illegal trade in cigarettes and the committing of crimes related to human trafficking in East Virginia and South Estonia in 2006.
Confidential criminal proceeds there are around EUR 71,500.
In these criminal matters, the success of police officers have ensured that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out actions together in any European Union country.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Mussour, which runs until August 28, 2017, invites all African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the state, taking into account the suspicious racial events that have recently taken place across the state and are listed here."
The NAACP said the group was encouraged to issue travel warnings both by a recent Missouri law making it harder to win discrimination lawsuits and the fact that the state's law enforcement agencies target, in large part, minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the side of the road because of the colour of their skin, beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP's Missouri branch, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had such close complaints before.'
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that in the state, black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than white people.
"It's meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be ready, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state 16th in the state's number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for a company to sue for discrimination in search of a home or job.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel notices for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws requiring people with local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but interest groups have recently begun to use the measure as a counter-reaction to certain U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different, A, B, C, D and hepatitis viruses.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C is a chronic cost, which can develop into cirrhosis of the liver, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer.
Listo Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Health Department, says acute hepatitis is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, thin excrement, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and the yellowness of the skin and mucus.
The popular name for liver inflammation also comes from the latest disease.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be identified based on data from laboratory studies.
Extreme hepatitis can transition into chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, meaning people may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the stools of an infected person to their hands and from their hands to their arms, surfaces, objects, objects, mouths and taking drugs.
Family members and caregivers of hepatitis infection, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with infected people, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A high spread.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccination for people travelling and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene compliance is important: wash or disinfect your hands, washing all fruit and vegetables before using it for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-duty, using blood-contaminated creatures (toothbrushes, waste products), donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis-cheek person, and from a hepatitis-stricken mother to foetus/born.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injection drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care workers and police officers who are exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high hepatitis B.
People can be vaccinated to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk are recommended, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharpeners and needles, tattooing and holeing, and using condoms in cases of condom-threatention or avoiding sexual risky behaviour.
Vaccinating hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and free for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to a sick person's blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, skulls, using blood-contaminated creatures, donor blood, having sex with hepatitis Cathedral and hepatitis-stricken mother to foetus/bean birth.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, people with HIV infection, and travelers visiting countries with high hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharpeners and syringe ants, tattooing and sniffing, and using condoms in cases of contagious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by a hepatitis D virus that reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in hepatitis B or as a super infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through contact with blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and rarely infected mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people with no immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from hepatitis D infection.
Hepatitis viruses spread through fetal-ord tea with drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used needles and infected mother to foetus.
Passengers can become infected in countries with hepatitis E high rates.
Hepatitis prevention measures include meeting hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Trees and vegetables to wash before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to sprint the four-time Olympic champion off course in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and children along the way with him after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in London in a row with a golden duo of 5,000 and 10,000 metres.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Dam in Gold; Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary tale of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait," delves much deeper into the origin story of one art work in the late 19th and early 20th centuries Vienna's cultural life.
But even more in history.
The awesome amount of information might have been worn out, a thinner cut, a narrower subject that allowed the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence.
There would be two books on the same cover: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in one cover, and the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in her painting "Daam in gold," and a much larger and comprehensive historical record of esteemed Jewish families and the German occupation, along with its after-effects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a bustling Vienna, and who have themselves in the Austrian capital, one can imagine, without the slightest effort, how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see a familiar name in the book, you feel like a more grammar culture.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where incursive syphilis was rampant and was the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to add to the story's development.
Or, perhaps, every pair of brushstrokes adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
The dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten residents of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele's parents were newcomers to Vienna, too, but by the time Adele married twice to open a Czech sugar magnate, Ferdinand Bloch, and Klimt was posing for his famous paintings, his father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't draw all the glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Dami's gold," it's hard to believe that towards the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
