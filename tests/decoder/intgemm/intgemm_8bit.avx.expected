Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in Spain and is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky, was detained by police in Spain, according to the Post.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took custody of three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspect is said to be members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society between the ages of 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mija, Malaga province, Spain.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of suspects in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal association and two are members of the criminal association, according to the data collected.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly distributed in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug crimes and thus generate criminal proceeds," said Vaur Verte, head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We are not ruling out increasing the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish counterparts has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," said prosecutor Verte.
Cleveland Police Service chief executive Ago Leis said the arrests were preceded by a year-and-a-half probe.
"In the first half of the long-running work, we have continued to have suspicions of crimes in Estonia and in Spain," he said.
The inquest added that federal police officers were assisting in the arrests in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men who have been on suspicion of committing new crimes can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution has requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized as part of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
Pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted of extortion by a district court in 2005 and sentenced to five years in prison.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after then-All-world leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to commit extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and demanded monthly rookie fees for businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come into force confirm that the fight in the area of organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight defendants from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Association criminal case who were ordered to have their criminal proceeds of EUR 80,000, or the judgment of nine individuals in 2006 for Igor Aleynikov, who aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the crimes of human trafficking in East Virginia and the South.
Confirl-based criminal income there is around EUR 71,500.
Success in these criminal matters has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out actions in any European Union country.
Civil rights group warns against traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Midsugar, which runs until 28 August 2017, calls on all African-Americans, visitors and Missouriers to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the state, taking into account the suspicious racial events that have occurred across the state recently and are being brought out here."
The NAACP said the group was encouraged to issue travel warnings both in the recent Missouri law making it harder to win discrimination lawsuits and the fact that the state's law enforcement agencies target minorities in an unequal way.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the edge of the road because of the colour of their skin, beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
This is the first such warning the organization has issued for the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note cites a recent report by the Missouri attorney general that shows that in the state, black motorists are 75% more likely to be stopped than white people.
"It's meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it's taking bail money or informing relatives that they're going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state 16th in the state's number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder for the company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel briefings for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have started using the measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the U.S..
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different, A, B, C, D and hepatitis E virus.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, the negative cost is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can develop into liver cirrhosis, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer.
Moodow Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Department of Health, says acute hepatitis is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, plantation, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, glandular extremities, dark urine, muscular and joint pain, and the collarbone of the skin and mucus.
The most recent disease also comes from the popular name for liver inflammation, collaboratories.
In children, hepatitis can go untreated.
Different types of inflammation can only be determined based on data from laboratory studies.
Extreme hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without signs of disease, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stool of an infected person's stool to their arms and from their hands to their arms, surfaces, objects, mouth and taking drugs.
The risk of hepatitis infection, or at-risk family members and carers, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected people, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A high-protein A.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, particularly for people travelling and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are essential: wash or disinfect your hands before using all fruit and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when they come into contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-armed, foxes of blood-soaked creatures (toothbrushes, waste products), donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis sushi personality, and from a hepatitis-death mother to foetal/born.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk have been recommended, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of alien hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and syringe-infested stints, tattooing and holeing, and using a condom in the event of infection-prone sex or avoiding sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free of charge for the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when a sick person's blood is exposed to, injected with drugs, tattooing, hole-in-aged, using blood contaminated with humans, having sex with a hepatitis person, and having hepatitis from mother to foetal/born.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug addicts, sextive partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and syringe-infections, tattooing and holeing, and using condoms for infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in combination with hepatitis B or a superficial infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through exposure to blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and from a rarely infected mother to the foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread fetal-oral teaspoon with drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to foetuses.
Passengers can become infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Preventive measures for hepatitis are hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Beat fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-profile beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to sprint off the four-time Olympic champion in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along with him after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I very much miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a golden duo of the 5,000 and 10,000 meters race in London for his fifth title race in a row.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold; Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" delves much deeper into the origin story of one artwork from the birth story of the late 19th and early 20th-century Vienna of the early 19th and early 20th-century Vienna.
But even more in history.
The awesome amount of information might have worn off a louder cut, a narrower subject that allowed the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence.
There would be two books now in one of the covers: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in her painting "Daam in Gold," and a much larger and comprehensive historical record of the esteemed Jewish families and the German occupation, along with its after-effects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a bustling Vienna, and whoever has themselves entered the Austrian capital can imagine, without the slight effort, how life went around Ringstrasse more than 100 years ago, or how everyone turned their heads around the Central Cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see the familiar name in the book, you feel more cultured.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where incurable syphilis was rampant and was Europe's highest suicide rate does nothing more about the development of the story.
Or perhaps, anyway, each pair of brushstrokes adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in ten of Vienna's residents were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open a Czech sugar magnate, Ferdinand Bloch, and Klimt was posing for her famous paintings, her father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't draw all the glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Dama in gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
